C programming is extensively used in several real-world applications, including:

1. Embedded Systems: C is popular in embedded systems. It is efficient and can interact directly with hardware. Real-world examples include microcontrollers, IoT devices, and consumer electronics. Arduino is an open-source electronics platform. C serves as the foundation. Developers widely use it for creating embedded systems. Hobbyists and professionals use it.

2. Operating Systems: Many OSs are written in C. It allows low-level access and is fast. Examples include Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS. They are all Unix-based and use C for their core functions. C is preferred for its ability to manage hardware and system resources.

3. Game Development: Today, developers often use Python and C# for games. But C is still essential for game engines, graphics libraries, and simulations. C's speed and control over hardware make it ideal for game engines. Other languages can extend it for complex features.
